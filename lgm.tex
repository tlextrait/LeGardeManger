\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Chantilly Cream}
\subsection*{Ingredients}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Heavy cream
		\item Sugar
	\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Procedure}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Beat the cream (an electric beater is highly recommended).  It helps if the cream and the bowl have been chilled in the freezer beforehand.
		\item When the cream develops soft peaks, add the sugar. Sifted confectioner's sugar is preferred.
		\item Additional flavors can be added with cocoa powder or vanilla extract.
	\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Notes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Never add hot items into the cream.
		\item Make sure there is no water in the bowl or on the whisk. Water would prevent the cream from hardening.
		\item Beaten cream can be kept in the fridge for 3 days.

\section*{Beating cream}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Beating cream}

\indent\indent Always use 'heavy cream', 'whipping cream' or 'whole cream'. Any reduced-fat cream will not beat. Make sure the mixing bowl is cold and completely dry. For best results, place the bowl and whisk in the fridge for a few minutes before beating. Then beat either by hand or using a mixer. 

Once the cream is hard enough that the whisk slices through it, you can optionally add flavorings in solid form such as sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla etc. Finer grain powders are better, such as confectioner's sugar. Sifting those can also help prevent the cream from collapsing.

Be careful, it you beat the cream too much it will transform into butter! Always keep the cream in the fridge until ready to be used.

\newpage
\section*{Beating egg whites}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Beating egg whites}

\indent\indent Beating egg whites is similar to beating heavy cream. Make sure the mixing bowl is cold and completely dry. Put in the egg whites, a pinch of salt and start mixing.

Egg whites can be mixed to different levels of hardness, and each recipe will require a specific hardness. When a recipe specifies 'hard peaks', it means you need to mix the egg whites until the whisk can slice through it. At that point, if you turn over the mixing bowl, the egg whites should remain stuck to the bottom and not fall out.

If the recipe require 'soft peaks', then it means the egg whites should create long peaks when you remove the whisk.

Egg whites can collapse very easily so if the recipe needs sugar to be added into the bowl, make sure it is confectioner's sugar and that it is sifted. Add only a little bit at a time, mix some more and repeat.
